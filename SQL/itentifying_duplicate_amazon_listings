--Business task: Compile list of duplicated product listings on our Amazon store
--Why: Delete unnecessary duplicates to avoid confusion on customer's end and avoid competing with ourselves on pricing


--Step 1: Create table in SQL database to house Amazon's raw .txt business report
CREATE TABLE listings_report_08012024 (
	Status text,
	Title text,
	Seller_SKU text,
	Product_ID_type text,
	Product_ID text,
	Condition text,
	Quantity text,
	Your_Price_USD text
);


--Step 2: Load empty table with data
COPY public.listings_report_08012024
FROM 'C:\Users\Public\all_listings_report_08012024.csv'
CSV HEADER;


--Step 3a: Asses if data was loaded properly 
SELECT *
FROM public.listings_report_08012024;


--Step 3b: Asses if number of rows correlates to number of product listings on Amazon
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.listings_report_08012024;


--Step 4a: Compile list of duplicated product listings
	--It was necessary to group by condition or listings with the same title 
  	  but different conditions (New, Used - Very Good, etc.) would show up as duplicates
SELECT title, product_id, condition, COUNT(title)
FROM public.listings_report_08012024
GROUP BY title, product_id, condition
HAVING COUNT(title) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(title) DESC;


--Step 4 supplement: Identify number of listings that may be affected in next business steps
SELECT SUM(count)
FROM (SELECT title, product_id, condition, COUNT(title) AS count
	FROM public.listings_report_08012024
	GROUP BY title, product_id, condition
	HAVING COUNT(title) > 1
	ORDER BY COUNT(title) DESC);

--Step 5: Export results to be presented in Excel
COPY
	(SELECT title, product_id, condition, COUNT(title)
	FROM public.listings_report_08012024
	GROUP BY title, product_id, condition
	HAVING COUNT(title) > 1
	ORDER BY COUNT(title) DESC)
TO 'C:\Users\Public\duplicated_listings_08012024.txt'
CSV HEADER;
